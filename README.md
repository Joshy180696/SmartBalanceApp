# SmartBalance 💰

Welcome to **SmartBalance**, a modern financial tracking application designed to help users manage their expenses and maintain a balanced budget. 
This project is built using **Blazor WebAssembly (WASM)** for the client-side and a custom **ASP.NET Core API** for backend functionality.

The app is actively in development, featuring secure user authentication, a responsive UI, and a dashboard with chart visualizations. Future updates will introduce advanced expense tracking, financial insights, and more!

## 🏗 Architecture

SmartBalance follows an **N-layer architecture** to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability:

1. **Presentation Layer** (`SmartBalanceApplication`)
   - Built with Blazor WASM and Radzen UI.
   - Handles user interactions (login, registration, home page, dashboard).
   - Communicates with the API via HTTP requests.

2. **Business Logic Layer (BLL)** (`SmartBalance.Api`)
   - Manages authentication and expense tracking logic.
   - Interacts with the Data Access Layer (DAL) through interfaces.

3. **Data Access Layer (DAL)** (`SmartBalance.Api`)
   - Uses Entity Framework Core to interact with Neon Postgres for data storage and retrieval.
